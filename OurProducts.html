        </h3>
        <img src="CBLF.PNG" alt="EVO oil">
        <p>
        This Extra Virgin Blend is a perfect choice for catering, as it is
        less fruity and intense than other oils, making it a versatile and
        adaptable choice for a variety of dishes. It is made from a blend
        of different olive varieties, including Coratina, Leccino, and
        Frantoio, which gives it a balanced flavour with hints of green
        apple, almond, and grass.
        Perfect for turning every meal into an authentic gastronomic
        experience.

        EVO Oil / Dorica Classico Blend - Medium Intense Fruity
        </h3>
        <img src="DCBMIF.PNG" alt="EVO oil">
        <p>
        A medium fruity, harmonious, and complete Extra Virgin Oil.
        Never toned down, it can respect the sharpest tastes and
        enhance the most delicate nuances of every dish. It is
        characterised by its balanced balsamic nuances and artichoke
        scent. The bitter and spicy tones are sharp but neat. It’s the
        perfect oil for light and delicate meals and is especially p
        appreciated by the sea chefs. This “artistic” expression of the
        Master oil producer will surely never disappoint.

        Grapessed Oil / Uvoilá
        </h3>
        <img src="GOU.PNG" alt="Grapessed oil">
        <p>
        Oil obtained only from Italian grape seeds (Vitis Vinifera L.)
        cold pressed, bleached, deodorised, deacidified and
        wintered. The refining process is exclusively physical and
        mechanical, chemical solvents are not used in any phase
        of the process. Its richness in antioxidants helps to
        highlight its protective properties on the overall health of
        the cardiovascular system. Grapeseed oil has a high smoke
        point of 215 degrees Celsius, making it ideal for
        high-temperature cooking methods such as frying,
        sautéing, and grilling.
